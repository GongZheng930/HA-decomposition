# HA-decomposition
This repository implements the decomposition introduced in [Gong(2025)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22097959/whhmaf.pdf) on heterogeneous-agent models' impulse response functions (IRFs) to aggregate shocks. The code is continuously updated.

The examples in the repository solve the model and implement the decomposition using the Sequence-Space Jacobian (SSJ) toolbox. Check https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian for more information on the toolbox.
